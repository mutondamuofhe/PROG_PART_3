Cybersecurity Awareness Assistant
Project Details
Project Name: PROG_PART_3

.NET Version: .NET 8.0 (LTS)

Template: WPF App (C#)

This project is a WPF desktop application developed to teach users about cybersecurity through an interactive assistant. It features a chatbot that responds to user queries, a task manager for cybersecurity to-dos, a quiz game to test knowledge, and an activity logâ€”all within a visually engaging GUI with sound and image elements.

Features
Chat Assistant:
Responds to user input using simulated keyword-based NLP for topics like cybersecurity risks, quiz, or task reminders.

Voice Greeting:
Automatically plays a greeting sound (voice_greeting.wav) when the application launches.

Task Manager:
Allows users to add, delete, and complete cybersecurity-related tasks. Tasks may also include reminders.

Security Quiz:
Offers a multiple-choice quiz with instant feedback and a score summary to help users test their cybersecurity knowledge.

Activity Log:
Logs chatbot responses, tasks, and quiz activities for user review.

Modern UI with Navigation Tabs:
GUI includes sections for Chat Assistant, Task Manager, Security Quiz, and Activity Log, all accessible through a tab-like button interface.

Background Image:
Uses a semi-transparent image (LOGO.jpg) as the background to enhance visual appeal.
